2. **Download** and **save** the program [metro.py](https://github.com/konstantinosy/graph-dsa/blob/main/metro.py).
3. **Download** and **save** the CSV file [processed_stations.csv](https://github.com/konstantinosy/graph-dsa/blob/main/processed_stations.csv).
4. For easier usage please have both files in the same directory.
